| `pnpm site:dev` | Run the official site |
| `pnpm build-only` | Build the main demo |

## Release Gate

Before publishing packages or deploying production, run the focused checks for the area you changed. Renderer and asset changes should at least pass:

```bash
pnpm build-only
pnpm docs:build
pnpm verify:format-support
pnpm verify:renderer-assets
pnpm verify:smoke-matrix
pnpm verify:npm-install-smoke
```

Use `pnpm verify:migration-gates` for a broader migration gate.
