  Flyfish Viewer is an offline-first frontend file preview system for web applications.
  It is designed for attachment centers, workflow tools, knowledge bases, support portals, and self-hosted intranet products that need broad file coverage without running a document conversion backend.

## Positioning

Flyfish Viewer is not trying to replace specialist editors. It gives business products a practical, embedded preview layer for common and uncommon attachments: documents, spreadsheets, slides, PDFs, archives, email, diagrams, CAD drawings, 3D assets, code, logs, media, and data files.

The project keeps a pure TypeScript core under `@file-viewer/core`, split renderer packages for heavier formats, native component packages for Web Components, Vue, React, jQuery, and Svelte, and product-shaped presets for common capability sets.

The 2.1.0 architecture is modular by default: use minimal renderer imports when you need one exact format, or choose `preset-lite`, `preset-office`, `preset-engineering`, or `preset-all` when your product needs a composed capability set. In Vite projects, `@file-viewer/vite-plugin` auto-discovers installed presets and injects the capability layer, so most teams do not hand-write renderer imports.

For heavy users that need everything immediately:

```bash
npm install @file-viewer/vue3 @file-viewer/preset-all
npm install -D @file-viewer/vite-plugin # optional for Vite
```

```ts
fileViewerRenderers({ copyAssets: true })
```
