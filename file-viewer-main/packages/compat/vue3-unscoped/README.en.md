# file-viewer3

`file-viewer3` is the historical unscoped compatibility package. It only re-exports `@file-viewer/vue3`. New integrations should prefer the standard package name `@file-viewer/vue3`.

```bash
npm install file-viewer3
```

```ts
import { createApp } from 'vue'
import FileViewer from 'file-viewer3'

import App from './App.vue'

createApp(App).use(FileViewer).mount('#app')
```
