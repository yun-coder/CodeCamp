# @flyfish-group/file-viewer

`@flyfish-group/file-viewer` is the historical Vue 2.7 compatibility package. It only re-exports the standard `@file-viewer/vue2.7` package. New integrations should prefer the standard package name.

```bash
npm install @flyfish-group/file-viewer
```

```ts
import Vue from 'vue'
import FileViewer from '@flyfish-group/file-viewer'

Vue.use(FileViewer)
```
