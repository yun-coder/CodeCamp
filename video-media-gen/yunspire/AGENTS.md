# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to Codex (Codex.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Git Commit Rules

- Git author is already configured for this repo, do not modify git config
- **NEVER** add `Co-Authored-By` lines in commit messages
- Push to GitHub remote (`github`) only, ignore `origin` (deprecated GitLab)

## Project Workflow Triggers

When the user asks to do any of the following in this repository:

- publish to the Yunspire GitHub mirror
- run the Yunspire GitHub publish workflow
- follow the Yunspire GitHub release or PR flow
- prepare a GitHub-safe branch, commit, push, or PR for Yunspire
- use `/yunspire-git-publish`

Treat that as a request to load and follow:

`.codex/workflows/yunspire-git-publish.md`

When the user asks to do any of the following in this repository:

- onboard a new model into Yunspire
- update model docs, model versions, defaults, or parameters
- refresh Wan / Kling / Vidu / PixVerse model support
- run the Yunspire model onboarding workflow
- review whether a model change is catalog-only or also needs runtime / UI work
- use `/yunspire-model-onboarding`

Treat that as a request to load and follow:

`.codex/workflows/yunspire-model-onboarding.md`

When the user asks to do any of the following in this repository:

- build the Yunspire desktop app
- package Yunspire Studio for macOS or Windows
- create a DMG or EXE build
- run the Yunspire desktop build workflow
- use `/yunspire-build`

Treat that as a request to load and follow:

`.codex/workflows/yunspire-build.md`

This repository does not rely on native slash commands in Codex. The strings `/yunspire-git-publish`, `/yunspire-build`, and `/yunspire-model-onboarding` are textual aliases for the workflows above.

## Workflow Files

- `.claude/commands/yunspire-git-publish.md` remains the Claude project command source.
- `.claude/commands/yunspire-build.md` remains the Claude project command source.
- `.claude/commands/yunspire-model-onboarding.md` remains the Claude project command source.
- `.codex/workflows/yunspire-git-publish.md` is the Codex workflow mirror for the same project process.
- `.codex/workflows/yunspire-build.md` is the Codex workflow mirror for the desktop build process.
- `.codex/workflows/yunspire-model-onboarding.md` is the Codex workflow mirror for model onboarding, catalog updates, and verification.

If both Claude and Codex guidance exist, preserve behavior parity unless the user asks for divergence.

# AI Comic Generator Platform

## Overview

The AI Comic Generator is a complete AI-powered comic video production platform that supports the full workflow from script to finished video. It uses Next.js frontend with FastAPI backend, integrating AI services like Qwen from Alibaba Cloud.

## Architecture

### Frontend
- Framework: Next.js 14 + React 18 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- State management: Zustand
- HTTP client: Axios
- 3D rendering: Three.js + @react-three/fiber
- Animation: Framer Motion

### Backend
- Framework: FastAPI (Python 3.11+)
- AI integration: Alibaba Cloud Qwen/Wanx services via DashScope
- Data validation: Pydantic
- File storage: Local + Alibaba Cloud OSS

## File Structure

### Output Management
Generated files are stored in `output/`:
```

├── assets/              # Character/scene/prop images
│   ├── characters/      # Character artwork
│   ├── scenes/          # Scene backgrounds

```

### Project Data
User project data is stored in `~/.spire/comic/`:
- `projects.json` - Main project database
- `app.log` - Application logs

## Key API Endpoints

### Project Management
- `POST /projects` - Create new project from script text
- `GET /projects` - List all projects
- `GET /projects/{id}` - Get project details
- `DELETE /projects/{id}` - Delete project
- `PUT /projects/{id}/reparse` - Reprocess script for project

### Asset Generation
- `POST /projects/{id}/generate_assets` - Generate all project assets
- `POST /projects/{id}/assets/generate` - Generate specific asset
- `POST /projects/{id}/assets/toggle_lock` - Lock/unlock asset
- `POST /projects/{id}/assets/update_image` - Update asset image

### Storyboard & Video
- `POST /projects/{id}/generate_storyboard` - Generate storyboards

- `POST /projects/{id}/art_direction/save` - Save art direction
- `GET /art_direction/presets` - Get style presets

## Development Guidelines

### Backend Changes
- Update Pydantic models in `src/apps/yunspire_gen/models.py` when modifying data structures
- Add new endpoints to `src/apps/yunspire_gen/api.py` using FastAPI conventions
- Implement business logic in appropriate modules in `pipeline.py`
- Use background tasks for AI processing operations

### Frontend Changes
- Add new API calls to `frontend/src/lib/api.ts`
- Create feature modules in `frontend/src/components/modules/`
- Use Zustand stores for shared state management
- Follow existing component structure patterns

### Configuration
- API keys can be configured via `.env` file or app settings dialog
- OSS configuration is optional but recommended for cloud storage
- Model settings can be changed per project via `update_model_settings`

## Debugging

### Common Issues
- FFmpeg not found: Install FFmpeg and ensure it's in PATH
- API keys missing: Configure via app settings or .env file
- OSS errors: Verify credentials and bucket permissions
- Video merge failures: Check if video files exist and have proper paths

### Logs
- Backend logs appear in terminal when running start_backend.sh
- Desktop app logs saved to: `~/.spire/comic/app.log`

## Deployment
- Frontend: Built with Next.js, can be deployed as static files
- Backend: Deploy with FastAPI server (Gunicorn recommended for production)
- Desktop app: Built with PyInstaller and pywebview

## Design Context

### Users
Primary: independent creators (self-media, short-video makers) who need to turn text scripts into comic-style videos quickly. Secondary: professional teams using it as a pre-production tool. Both share a need for speed and creative control — they think in stories, not in software.

### Brand Personality
**Creative · Immersive · Geeky** — Yunspire feels like a creator's cockpit, not an admin panel. It respects the user's craft while putting AI power at their fingertips. The tagline "Render Noise into Narrative" captures the mission: raw ideas in, polished stories out.

### Aesthetic Direction
- **Dark-first**: Deep space black (#050508) background, no light mode. The darkness lets content (images, videos, storyboards) be the hero.
- **Glassmorphism**: Frosted glass panels (5% white + backdrop-blur) for structure. Layered transparency creates depth without clutter.
- **Neon accents**: Electric blue (#646cff) primary, hot pink (#ff0080) accent. Used sparingly for interactive elements and emphasis — not decoration.
- **Brand gradient**: Purple → Indigo → Pink (the "X" in Yunspire). Reserved for branding moments, not sprinkled everywhere.
- **Typography**: Space Grotesk (display/headings — geometric, modern), Inter (body — clean, readable), JetBrains Mono (code/technical values).
- **Anti-references**: No dense tables/forms that feel like enterprise admin. No excessive particles/animations that distract from content. No multi-panel professional tool complexity (not Figma/Photoshop).

### Design Principles

1. **Content is king**: The user's creations (scripts, storyboards, videos, assets) should always be the visual focus. UI chrome stays quiet until needed.
2. **Progressive disclosure**: Show only what matters at each step. Advanced settings (prompt config, model settings) are accessible but not in-your-face. Use collapsible sections and contextual reveals.
3. **Confidence through feedback**: Every action should have clear, immediate visual feedback — loading states, success confirmations, smooth transitions. The user should always know what's happening and feel in control.
4. **Consistent glass language**: All containers use the glass-panel pattern. Inputs use glass-input. Buttons use glass-button or primary fills. No mixing of visual metaphors.
5. **Purposeful motion**: Framer Motion for meaningful transitions (enter/exit, state changes). Staggered reveals for lists. No gratuitous animation — every movement communicates something.
