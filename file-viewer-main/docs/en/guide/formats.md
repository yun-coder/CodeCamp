# Supported Formats

<div class="doc-kicker">Format Truth</div>

<p class="doc-lead">
  The current core declares 24 preview pipelines and 206 file extensions.
  Renderers are loaded on demand, so opening a lightweight text file does not force the browser to load every heavy document engine.

## Engineering Renderer Notes

- Word preview uses `@file-viewer/renderer-word`. The package lazy-loads the self-maintained DOCX engine, `msdoc-viewer`, and RTF/OpenDocument helpers only for DOCX/DOC/RTF/ODT files, so core-only and lightweight component installs do not pull Word engines by default.
- XMind uses `@file-viewer/renderer-mindmap` with XMind 8 XML and XMind 2020+ JSON package parsing, plus an `@panzoom/panzoom` powered canvas for drag panning, node-start dragging, mobile pinch zoom, keyboard panning, responsive fit-on-open/host-resize behavior, and unified toolbar state sync after pan/navigation.
- Mermaid and PlantUML are handled by `@file-viewer/renderer-drawing`. Mermaid lazy-loads the official `mermaid` renderer and outputs theme-aware SVG. PlantUML stays offline by default with an SVG source preview; configure `options.drawing.plantumlServerUrl` when an intranet PlantUML SVG service is available. If the endpoint is unavailable, the viewer renders the same offline preview instead of leaving the page blank. Both diagram surfaces support drag panning and renderer-native zoom controls through `@panzoom/panzoom`.
- Patch files are rendered with `diff2html` in side-by-side mode. Git bundles parse the bundle header, refs, commit objects, trees, readable blobs, and regular OFS_DELTA / REF_DELTA pack objects directly in the browser; very large packs or bundles that depend on external prerequisites surface a clear boundary notice instead of being silently misrepresented.
- EDA uses `@file-viewer/renderer-eda`. OLB and DRA are safe structure previews over common CFB/OLE2 containers, standard GDSII renders small layouts as SVG and larger element sets through WebGL typed-array batches, readable OASIS text fixtures render as SVG, and real SEMI binary OASIS remains a safe structure-index preview until the dedicated WASM/WebGL layout kernel is split out.
- CAD uses `@file-viewer/renderer-cad` and `@flyfish-dev/cad-viewer`; DWG, DWF, and DWFx assets remain self-hostable for offline deployments.
- STEP, IGES, IFC, 3DM, and BREP use the `@file-viewer/renderer-3d` entry plus the lightweight `@file-viewer/geometry-engine` route package for signature detection and accurate conversion guidance. Full visual decoding still belongs in dedicated OpenCascade / web-ifc / rhino3dm WASM paths, not in core or default component installs.

## Capability Model

Each renderer reports what it can safely do. The common toolbar then shows download, print, HTML export, zoom, search, and navigation only when the active file type supports those operations.

This avoids pretending that every format supports the same operations. Word and PDF can use full-page print adapters, images can zoom naturally, archives can lazy-extract nested entries, and virtual spreadsheet tables are provided by `@file-viewer/renderer-spreadsheet` to avoid fragile outer CSS scaling.

## Best Evaluation Path

1. Open the [live demo](https://demo.file-viewer.app).
2. Try the sample closest to your production files.
3. Test your own file through upload or URL.
4. Use the [comparison demo](https://demo.file-viewer.app/compare.html) for contract, report, and generated-output review.
5. If your deployment is offline or CSP-restricted, run `npx file-viewer-copy-assets ./public/file-viewer` and point renderer assets to your own static path.
